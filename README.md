# DNA Pattern Matching
> This small project is created for IF2211 Algorithm Strategies assignment. This project is about pattern matching for detecting diseases by checking the similiarity of the DNA. It will required the DNA of the disease and the patient. It will show the similiriaty of DNA diseases in the patient's DNA.
> Live demo [_here_](https://tubes3-stima-five.vercel.app/). <!-- If you have the project hosted somewhere, include the link here. -->

## General Information
This project is about String Matching and Regular Expression. String Matching and Regular Expression are used for DNA Pattern Matching to predict patient disease by looking at its DNA. The algorithm that been used for String Matching are Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm and Boyer-Moore algorithm. You can choose one of them in the web application. This project is one of the assignment that given in IF2211 Algorithm Strategies.
